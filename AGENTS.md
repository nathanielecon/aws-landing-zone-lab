# Harness rules

- Run only the approved manifest whose `PLAN.md` SHA-256 matches
  `harness/plan-approval.json`.
- Use one sequential Ralphy process. Never add parallel, sandbox, worktree,
  branch-per-task, browser, PR, or automatic merge flags.
- Codex must not commit. `scripts/Invoke-CodexAdapter.ps1` is the only task
  commit authority.
- Never widen Codex beyond `workspace-write`.
- Runtime state and verbose logs must remain untracked and sanitized.
- Do not clean, reset, stash, or overwrite unexplained user changes.

## Scope

This repository is the Ralphy/Codex **smoke harness**. AWS Landing Zone lab work
belongs in [`nathanielecon/aws-landing-zone-lab`](https://github.com/nathanielecon/aws-landing-zone-lab).
